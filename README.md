# Test Custom `valohai.yaml`

Test using custom `valohai.yaml` file(s) on Valohai

- no `valohai.yaml` in the repo root
- multiple different `valohai.yaml` files in subdirectories
- directory paths with different length

## Creating a Project

1. Go to the Valohai app and start creating a new project.
2. Give the project a name (e.g. `custom-yaml-test`)
3. Probably best to select a suitable organization as the project owner.
4. Click on _Create Project_.
5. Go to _Settings > Repository_ and add this repository as _URL_.
6. Type `local_conf/valohai.yaml` as _YAML Path_ and _Save changes_.
7. Click _Fetch repository_. Valohai should fetch 1 new commit to the project.
8. Check that everything is ok by goingo to _Settings > Repository > Commits_, selecting the commit, and making sure you see the configuration defined in `local_conf/valohai.yaml`.

## Running an Execution

You should be able to run the `hello-world` execution in the Valohai app UI.

To run the execution from the command line, you need to link the local repository directory to the project:

```shell
vh project link
```

Now, you can run the execution from the command line:

```shell
vh execution run say-hello
```

## Running a Pipeline

Letâ€™s add a pipeline to the mix.

(Very trivial pipeline is included in the YAML).

- âœ”ï¸Ž Running the pipeline as ad-hoc from CLI
- ðŸš« Cannot run the pipeline with `vh pipeline run hello`
  - Complains about `valohai.yaml` â€“ trying to look for it in the root directory.
- âœ”ï¸Ž Explicitly setting the project ID works around the issue:
  - `vh --project=<PROJECT_UUID> pipeline run hello`
